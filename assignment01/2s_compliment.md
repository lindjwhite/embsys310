**Hopefully** it's cool if I quote a website as the answer... "When doing addition/subtraction on binary numbers in other representations we need to apply different logics (circuits) to perform addition and subtraction. In 2s-complement representation, we represent a positive number as it is and negative number by its corresponding 2s-complement, so we can use the same circuit to perform addition and subtraction." - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-are-negative-numbers-stored-as-2s-complement/#:~:text=In%202s%2Dcomplement%20representation%2C%20we,to%20perform%20addition%20and%20subtraction.)
